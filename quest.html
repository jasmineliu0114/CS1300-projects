        <h1>Quest Water Dispenser: How has COVID-19 impacted design?</h1>
        <p>A few months ago, the Data Science Institute at Brown University replaced their old water  dispenser with a new Quest COVID-19 model. This new model introduces hovering to activate sensors, removing the need for users to touch the machine. However, this begs the questions: what sorts of trade-offs does this new feature introduce in the design of a water dispenser?</p>

        <h2>The Machine</h2>
        <p>First, let's get to know the interface of the Quest water dispenser.</p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <p>To get a sense of radio button characteristics, we explore and compare inputs from mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen users for three applications: Google Forms, Amazon Checkout, and Outlook Settings. This includes a focus on what users can and cannot do, functionalities that are learnable, memorable, and efficient, and comparisons between the three applications on interaction and accessibility. </p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>Like the section above, we also explore and compare the outputs of the same three applications. In addition to mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen users, there is an additional focus on user who may be using screen readers as well.</p>

        <p>Now that we've explored these three radio button applications, let's select one to analyze and revise. State models can be used to help visualize which radio button inputs result in certain outputs.</p>
