        <h1>Accessible Components: Radio Buttons</h1>
        <p>This project explores the design of radio buttons and how changes in the design make trade-offs between learnability, memorability, efficiency, and accessibility for mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, and screen reader users.</p>

        <h2>Inputs</h2>
        <p>To get a sense of radio button characteristics, we explore and compare inputs from mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen users for three applications: Google Forms, Amazon Checkout, and Outlook Settings. This includes a focus on what users can and cannot do, functionalities that are learnable, memorable, and efficient, and comparisons between the three applications on interaction and accessibility. </p>
        <h3>Google Forms Radio Buttons</h3>

        <img src="assets/amazon_2.png" alt="Google Forms Radio buttons with item selected and text highlighted" style="width:100%; max-height:300px;">
        <h3>Outlook Settings Radio Buttons</h3>
        <div class="image-text-container" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
            <img src="assets/outlook_1.png" alt="Outlook settings Radio buttons with Large item selected" style="width:100%; max-height:200px;">

                    <ul>
                        <li>Hovering highlights the button.</li>
                        <li>Click+release the button or the label space selects and unselects the button. Clicking on the label instead of the button is not immediately obvious but is easily learnable. This feature is also efficient, as the user doesn't have to move their mouse all the way to the button to select.</li>
                        <li>Double-clicking the label text highlights a word and triple-clicking highlights the whole label, but these actions also activate/deactivate the button with each click.</li>
                        <li>Clicking and dragging also highlights label text and activates/deactivates the button. This could be less efficient since it can select/unselect the button when undesired.</li>
                        <li>Highlighted text can be copy and pasted to clipboard.</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td style="vertical-align: top;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Click+release the button or the label space selects and unselects the button.</li>
                        <li>Unlike Google Forms, hovering over a button does not highlight the button or do anything at all.</li>
                        <li>Users cannot click to unselect a payment method. In the context of this application, this is efficient because one of the payment methods list must be selected in order to complete a purchase.</li>
                        <li>Double/triple-clicking and clicking+dragging the mouse highlights label text and selects the corresponding radio button. However, there is no deactivating of the button that occurs like in the case of Google Forms.</li>
                        <li>Highlighted text can be copy and pasted to clipboard.</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td style="vertical-align: top;">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Like the other two applications, click+release the button or the label space selects and unselects the button.</li>
                        <li>Hovering makes the label text slightly darker.</li>
                        <li>Unlike the other two applications, the user cannot select text in the label, neither by double/triple-clicking or by clicking and dragging the mouse. </li>
                        <li>Like the Amazon checkout payment application, users cannot click a radio button to deactivate the selection. Again, this is efficient because one of the options has to be selected.</li>
                        <li>Like the other two applications, the circular buttons make the action of selecting item easy to learn and memorable, as it is an interface that is consistent across all different applications.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </td>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If no items are selected, tab highlights the first radio button with a light purple circle. Otherwise, the selected radio button is highlighted.</li>
                        <li>To navigate to each radio button, the user uses the up/left and down/right arrow keys. This action also activates the radio button that the user moves to. This is not immediately obvious and required a few different keyboard button presses to figure out but is easy to learn and memorize once discovered. It is also pretty efficient, since it moves and selects in one action.</li>
                        <li>Clearing a selection requires pressing tab to highlight the Clear selection button and hitting enter. This is efficient in the sense that it requires fewer key presses than navigating over to the radio button a user wants to deactivate but less efficient in terms of having to leave the radio button space in order to select the Clear selection button.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Tab highlights the selected radio button with a circle outlining the button.</li>
                        <li>Like Google Forms, the up/left and down/right keys navigates to and selects the upper/lower radio button.</li>
                        <li>As previously mentioned, users cannot deactivate radio buttons, so there is no keyboard action for this either.</li>
                    </ul>

                <td style="vertical-align: top;">

                        <li>Tab highlights the selected radio button with a rectangle outlining both the radio button and its label.</li>
                        <li>Up/left and down/right arrows navigate and select the upper/lower radio buttons, like in the other two applications. Also like the other two, pressing up/left on the top item or down/right on the last item wraps the navigation to the other end of the list, which also make for more efficient navigation.</li>
                        <li>Again, users cannot deactivate radio buttons, so there is no keyboard action for this either.</li>
                    </ul>

A selected button is filled with a slightly smaller colored button, and the original black circle outline also becomes colored. However, unlike the other two applications, the selected radio button and corresponding label are also highlighted by a translucent box.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iccWRhKZa8&ab_channel=99U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kat Holmes' Inclusive Design</a>, we reflect on the observations and revision made above. Here are the key points regarding usability and accessibility of the different design choices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The radio button components provided clear visual feedback using hover effects, focus indicators, and active states, which help to improve discoverability.</li>
            <li>Keyboard navigation was also clear, as tab and arrow key interactions allowed keyboard users to interact effectively.</li>
            <li>The redesigned radio buttons are designed with even stronger visual indicator, not only highlighting elements more clearly for users who may have low vision, but also making it clearer that both radio buttons and their associated labels can be clicked to select/deselect.</li>
            <li>Standardizing the user flow between different input states by giving mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, and voice reader users the choice to select/deselect benefits both efficiency and accessibility.</li>
            <li>One positive accessibility impact of radio button selection method, particularly for Amazon Checkout and Outlook settings is a clear focus box for keyboard users to ensure they know which radio button they are selecting.</li>
            <li>A negative accessibility impact of auto-selection using arrow keys is that users who accidentally press an arrow key may change their selection without realizing it.</li>
            <li>Mouse and keyboard users seem to get the most prioritization, which touchscreen and users can face some inconsistencies. While screen-readers seem to be giving user all the necessary information, the organization of that information seem to be more of an afterthought. This could affect the user experience for those who may rely on an input method and make certain applications harder for them to use.</li>
        </ul>
