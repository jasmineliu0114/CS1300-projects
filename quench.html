        <h1>Quench Water Dispenser: How has COVID-19 impacted design?</h1>
        <p>A few months ago, the Data Science Institute at Brown University replaced their old water  dispenser with a new Quench COVID-19 model. This new model introduces hovering to activate sensors, removing the need for users to touch the machine. However, this begs the questions: what sorts of trade-offs does this new feature introduce in the design of a water dispenser?</p>

        <h2>The Machine</h2>
        <p>First, let's get to know the interface of the Quench water dispenser. This Quench water dispenser is a COVID-19 model that incorporates sensors that users can hover over to make selections. It includes one sensor that is used to select different water options and another sensor that is used to dispense water.</p>

        <h2>Interviews</h2>
        <p>Next, let's conduct some interviews to learn about some experiences users have while interacting with this interface.</p>
        <h3>The Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Can you describe how often you use the quench water dispenser in a typical day or week?</li>
            <li>What are the main reasons you choose to use this dispenser over other available options?</li>
            <li>How easy or difficult is it to access and operate the dispenser? Can you provide an example?</li>
            <li>How does it compare to other dispensers you've used on campus?</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="interview-box1">
            <h3>Interviewee 1</h3>
            <h4>Observations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hovers the top of the fingers in front of the sensor with the whole hand open to activate.</li>
                <li>Tried some sparkling water but then switched to the cold water option.</li>
                <li>Placed the water bottle on the bottom tray.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Interview Responses:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>First-time user who wanted to try the sparkling water. Usually uses the Quench machine in the CIT.</li>
                <li>Same as 1.</li>
                <li>The process was extremely easy since the interviewee is already experienced with another Quench interface. The machine in the DSI does have more water options, but it was easy to figure out how to switch.</li>
                <li>It is the fanciest water dispenser that the interviewee has used. The one in the CIT only has cold and room temperature options. The interviewee hasn't seen any other Quench water dispensers on campus.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="interview-box1">
            <h3>Interviewee 2</h3>
            <h4>Observations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses thumb to activate the sensor.</li>
                <li>Touches finger to the sensor instead of hovering.</li>
                <li>Held water bottle directly under the spout.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Interview Responses:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Uses the machine 3 times/day whenever they are at the DSI.</li>
                <li>It's the only water dispenser in the DSI besides the filtered water spout attached to the sink. Prefers the Quench machine because it is automatic and doesn't require pressing down a switch.</li>
                <li>Initially was confusing to use, and the interviewee was not sure how to switch modes. It is also not the smartest interface since you have to press 3 times to get to the hot water option. Additionally, when first using it, the interviewee was not sure how sensitive the sensor was or how close to place their finger. (i.e. do you have to touch the display?) The icon below the sensor also wasn't very helpful in clarifying whether it's touch- or hover-activated.</li>
                <li>The DSI used to have an older water dispenser that was not as fancy but easier to use. It had buttons for each of the water options, and you just pressed the corresponding button for the water option to come out.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="interview-box1">
            <h3>Interviewee 3</h3>
            <h4>Observations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses pointer finger to activate.</li>
                <li>Tried to press the water options icons to switch modes.</li>
                <li>Noted color differences for each of the modes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Interview Responses:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>First-time user who doesn't come to the DSI often.</li>
                <li>It's the only option in the DSI to get water from.</li>
                <li>It was not very intuitive because the interviewee had first tried to press the different options. Learned to use it correctly after noticing the hover icon. The interviewee also found it a bit annoying to have to hover multiple times to get to the hot option.</li>
                <li>Compared to other water dispensers, the interviewee found this Quench machine to be a little bit less intuitive because they had expected it to be touchscreen.</li>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>Now that we've interviewed our users, let's contruct two personas that would interact with out Quench machine.</p>
        <div class="interview-box3">
            <h3>Dr. Wagner</h3>
            <p>Dr. Wagner is a busy DSI faculty member. She finds the method of switching to the hot water option to be inconvenient and inefficient. Dr. Wagner represents the faculty members who have offices in the DSI and who use the dispenser often. They likely have a busy schedule and want to maximize efficiency to save time.</p>

        <div class="interview-box3">
            <h3>Jordan</h3>
            <p>Jordan is a Master's student who only comes to the DSI for a bi-weekly meeting for a project. He is usually in and out, so he has never used the water dispenser at the DSI before. He found out from a friend that the water dispenser at the DSI has sparkling water, so he went to go check it out after his meeting. Jordan represents users who are unfamiliar with the Quench touchless interface and may find it confusing.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The Quench water dispenser represents a thoughtful response to the contactless needs of a post-COVID world. However, this investigation revealed that the hover-based interface, while hygienic, introduces usability challenges for both frequent and first-time users. Through direct observation, interviews, and persona development, we uncovered that clarity in interaction cues and mode-switching efficiency are key areas for improvement. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This project taught me the value of engaging directly with users to understand their needs, habits, and frustrations. Conducting interviews revealed nuances in how different people interact with the same interface, as what feels intuitive to one user can be confusing to another. These real-world insights were essential in moving beyond assumptions and toward a more informed design perspective.
